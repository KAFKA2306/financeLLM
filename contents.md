I'll analyze these Python files and explain the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system implementation. Let me break down the key components and explain how they work together.

The codebase implements a RAG system with several key components:

1. Core Components Overview

The system consists of three main Python files:
- `rag_test.py`: A basic implementation of the RAG system with core functionality
- `ragout.py`: An enhanced version with better logging, error handling, and file management
- `chat_test.py`: A chat interface for interacting with different LLM models

2. Key Features and Architecture

The RAG system uses several important components:

Text Embedding:
```python
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="intfloat/multilingual-e5-large",
    model_kwargs={'device': 'cpu'}
)
```
This uses the multilingual-e5-large model for creating text embeddings, which is particularly useful for handling both English and Japanese content.

Text Splitting:
```python
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=100,
    length_function=len
)
```
The system splits documents into manageable chunks with overlap to maintain context across splits.

Vector Storage:
```python
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)
```
FAISS is used for efficient similarity search of embedded text chunks.

3. Enhanced Features in `ragout.py`

The enhanced version includes several improvements:

Document Processing:
```python
def read_pdf(self, pdf_path: str) -> Tuple[str, bool]:
    try:
        text = []
        with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:
            pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
            for page in pdf_reader.pages:
                text.append(page.extract_text())
        return "\n".join(text), True
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error reading PDF {pdf_path}: {str(e)}")
        return "", False
```
This handles PDF document reading with proper error handling and logging.

Comprehensive Logging:
```python
def setup_logging(self):
    log_dir = self.output_dir / "logs"
    log_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    log_file = log_dir / f"rag_run_{timestamp}.log"
```
The system maintains detailed logs of all operations for debugging and monitoring.

4. Query Processing Pipeline

The system processes queries through several steps:

1. Document Retrieval:
```python
def retrieve_documents(self, query: str, vector_store: FAISS, k: int = 3) -> List[str]:
    docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=k)
    return [doc.page_content for doc in docs]
```

2. Response Generation:
```python
def generate_response(self, query: str, context: List[str]) -> str:
    prompt = f"""Based on the following context, please answer the question. If you cannot find relevant information in the context, respond with "分かりません".

Context:
{chr(10).join(context)}

Question: {query}"""
```

5. Error Handling and Robustness

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

```python
def parse_llm_response(self, response_text: str) -> str:
    try:
        if not response_text.strip().startswith('{'):
            return response_text.strip('"\'')
            
        response_json = json.loads(response_text)
        # Handle various response formats
        if isinstance(response_json, dict):
            if "response" in response_json:
                return response_json["response"]
            elif "generated_text" in response_json:
                return response_json["generated_text"]
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.warning(f"Error parsing response: {str(e)}")
        return response_text
```

This implementation is particularly well-suited for handling ESG reports and integrated reports due to its:
- Multilingual support through the e5-large model
- Robust PDF processing capabilities
- Flexible response parsing for different LLM formats
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the system?
